# Features and plans

This is just where I jot down things I want the system to have.

# The list

* WiFi AP mode
    * Enable AP mode with WPA2-PSK for encrypted communication
    * Enable AP mode without encryption for open connections

* HTTP Server
    * run server in HTTPS mode
    * Offer blind drop-uploads (what max size?)
